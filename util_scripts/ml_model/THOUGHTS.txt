the ML model needs to construct a dataset based on
strongly partisan spliting bills.

Any bill that has an inordinate amount of Yeas in one party,
while the other party has an opposing matched amount of Nays 
is ideal.




Test SQL Query to Retrieve Information:
        SELECT * FROM BillInfoDB.ml_bill_info_table 
                                where ( ( ( RepublicanYea/RepublicanNay )>1 ) AND ( ( DemocratYea/DemocratNay)<.20 ) ) 
				or    ( RepublicanYea=0 and RepublicanNay!=0 )
                                or    ( DemocratYea=0 and DemocratNay!=0);
